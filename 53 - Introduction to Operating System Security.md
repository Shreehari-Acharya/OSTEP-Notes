### Importance of OS Security

- Security of computing systems is vital and increasingly important
- OS security is particularly critical because:
    - Everything runs on top of the OS
    - OS has control over all hardware resources
    - OS is large and complex, increasing likelihood of flaws
    - OS must support multiple concurrent processes

### What We're Protecting

- Essentially everything the OS controls, including:
    - Process memory
    - Files and storage
    - CPU scheduling
    - Network communication
    - Peripheral devices
    - System calls and OS services

### Security Goals and Policies

### Key Security Goals

- Confidentiality - Keep sensitive information hidden
- Integrity - Prevent unauthorized changes to data/systems
- Availability - Ensure authorized access to resources

### Security Policies

- Specific rules to achieve security goals
- OS provides mechanisms to implement flexible policies
- Policies must be carefully designed and applied

### Principles for Designing Secure Systems

- Economy of mechanism - Keep systems simple
- Fail-safe defaults - Default to secure settings
- Complete mediation - Check every access
- Open design - Assume attacker knows system details
- Separation of privilege - Require multiple credentials
- Least privilege - Grant minimal necessary permissions
- Least common mechanism - Separate mechanisms when possible
- Acceptability - Make security usable

### Basic OS Security Mechanisms

- Process isolation and virtual memory
- Controlled hardware access
- System call checks
- Access control on OS services

### Key Takeaways

- OS security is critical but challenging
- Goals focus on confidentiality, integrity, availability
- Mechanisms enable flexible security policies
- Good design principles help create more secure systems
